# Project 1 - UCF Coding Bootcamp

With this project, we were tasked to use everything we have learned, to this point, to create a web application of our choosing. We chose to make a website that displays local restaurants, breweries, and events after a user enters a city into a search input. 


## User Story

``` 
As A traveler trying to party like it’s 1999

SO THAT I can plan to eat, drink, and party accordingly 
```
