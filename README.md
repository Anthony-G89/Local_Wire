# Project 1 - UCF Coding Bootcamp

With this project, we were tasked to use everything we have learned, to this point, to create a web application of our choosing. We chose to make a website that displays local restaurants, breweries, and events after a user enters a city into a search input. This project was created using HTML, custom CSS, Materialize CSS Framework, JS, jQuery, AJAX calls, and 3 API's: 

Brewery API: https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation/01-listbreweries

Restaurants API: https://developers.zomato.com/api

TicketMaster API: https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/


## User Story

``` 
As A traveler trying to party like it’s 1999
I WANT to see local events, restaurants, and breweries for a city
SO THAT I can plan to eat, drink, and party accordingly 
```
